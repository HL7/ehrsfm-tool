NOTES
=====
MAXExporter - uses the EA API through COM
MAXExporter2 - uses EA SQL XML calls (is somewhat faster)

TODO
====
- MAXImporter: 
	- update of attributes gives "Action not supported" Exception
	- how to detect deletes of objects/relationships when updating
- MAXExporter:
	- also support Diagrams -> Diagram serves as a selection of the elements to export!
	- cannot get "alias" of attributes in SQLXML?
	- ?? add option to export Markedup notes with xhtml namespace or XML escaped
	- Why is the <notes>-element always created?
	- Why is the required <name>-element not always created?
	- !! Handle Composition and DirectedAssociation RelationshipTypes!
	- Ignored Object_Types are e.g. Boundary. Should we also ignore Text, Note? and NoteLink?
- MAXSchema:
	- sync UML model of schema (in EAP)!
	- fix namespace of all elements to "max:"
- Excel binding document, figure out multi tagged value binding; <tag><value><notes>
	- Q: Multiple tagged values with the same name result in multiple elements with the samen name, how to handle that in a spreadsheet?
	  A: Through an XSLT!

ISSUE!! EA uses system configured dateformat, DateFormat.Parse doesnot???
	Workaround: set system dateformat English (VS)
	Combinations tried: 
		Windows Language Dutch + Date Format: Dutch & English -> works
		Windows Language English + Date Format: Dutch doesnot work, English -> works

CHANGELOG
=========
[2013-sep-26]
MAXImproter3/MAXExporter3: Applied some Resharper suggestions.
MAXExporter3:
- Added start of export from Diagram in Comments!

[2013-sep-23]
- Moved some paths to "C:\Temp" instead of "D:\"
MAXExporter3:
- EA uses system configured dateformat. Try both CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture via try/catch workaround

[2013-jul-17]
MAXExporter3:
- Ignore ObjectType and RelationshipTypes that are not in the XSD

[2013-jul-13]
MAXImporter3:
- More robust import for Package with ParentID
- eaPackageDict was not constructed with correct ID
- MAX::ID overrules ElementID when constructing eaElementDict, not both!

[2013-jul-11]
MAXImporter3:
- More robust count. Code expected at least the objects AND relationships tags.

[2013-jul-01]
MAXSchema.xsd
- Added RelationshipType enum "Package" used for "<import>"
MAXExporter3:
- Forgot object@abstract & attribute@isReadOnly _Specified_
- relationship@sourceLabel, @destLabel

[2013-jun-30]
MAXImporter3:
- Return bool if there were any issues.

[2013-jun-23]
MAXImporter/MAXExporter/MAXExporter2
- removed, really old now
MAXImporter3/Exporter3/MAXSchema
- create and use MAXSchema model using XSD.exe
- also now import attribute tags!

[2013-jun-21]
MAXExporter2:
- default filename based on package name + ".max.xml"
- add export of package tagged values, attributes & attribute tagged values
- add cardinalities & labels for relationships
MAXModel:
- add attributes + tagged values
- add cardinalities & labels for relationships
MAXSchema:
- add tagged values for attributes

[2013-jun-14]
MAXImporter,Input/MAXSchema.xsd:
- object@isAbstract, attribute@isReadOnly, attribute@alias

[2013-jun-13]
Input/MAXSchema.xsd:
- relationship/id is optional and not used at the moment
- added optional attribute@minCard/@maxCard
- added optional relationship@sourceLabel,@sourceCard,@destLabel,@destCard
MAXImporter:
- dont use XPathSelect, just use Element/Elements for minor speed improvement
- added optional attribute cardinality and relationship labels and cardinality
- BUG FIXED: parentId was case sensitive and should not be

[2013-may-07]
MAXExporter2:
- Made it more robust by adding and using Extension Methods to XElement that check for null.

[2013-apr-24]
MAXExporter2:
- Package_ID and Object_ID are 2 idspace. So there can be an Package with id=5 and an object with id=5.
  In EA a Package has both ID's. MAX has only one idspace and therefore has to use Object_ID. Fixed.
ProgressWindow:
- on-top of parent instead of on-top of all.
MAXImporter:
- Also set Package TreePos!

[2013-apr-18]
MAXExporter2:
- Repository.EnableCache to speedup export!

[2013-apr-12]
MAXExporter2:
- join t_package and t_object reliable on ea_guid instead of unreliable Name
  ea_guid is the same for the Package and its Element

[2013-mrt-28]
MAXImporter:
- Replaced "\n" to "\r\n" == newline in EA notes!

[2013-mrt-26]
MAXImporter/MAXSchema.xsd:
- Implemented attributes
- Relationship type Composition -> Closed Aggregation
- Keep order of objects and attributes in Project Browser (using Element.TreePos, Attribute.Pos)

[2013-mrt-19]
MAXImporter:
- Also import Packages and new tag format
MAXExporter2:
- Stereotype of object can be NULL, check for that.
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>
MAXExporter:
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>

[2013-mrt-15/16/17]
QuickAccessViewControl:
- Added Quick Access Buttons View!
MAXExporter2:
- Reimplementation of the MAX Exporter using the SQLQuery interface to the UML Model.
- Keep HTML formatting as unescaped XML in the Package and Element notes. Not for TaggedValues since no formatting is allowed there.
- Add "exportDate" attribute to model element.
- Added selected package

[2013-mrt-13]
MAXExporter/Importer:
- Tagged values in repeating child "tag" element with name, value and notes childs. If you want to use in spreadsheet, use a transform.
- MaxExporter: experimental add attribute child elements.
- MAXExporter: export in background thread

[2013-mrt-06]
-- Separated MAX classes from UMCG_EA_AddIn.

[2013-mrt-06]
MAXExporter:
- on export add/update MAX::LastExportDate tag to exported package
MAXImporter:
- on import add/update MAX::LastImportDate tag to imported package

[2013-feb-27]
MAXExporter/Importer/xsd:
- added optional "Element.modified" property to object

[2012-nov-21]
MAXExporter:
- For now replace ':' in Tagged Values with a '_'

[2012-nov-19]
MAXSchema.xsd:
- added alias attribute of object
MAXExporter:
- Add support from Package (for all Elements) and Diagram to filter Elements
- Include parentId for nested Elements
- Include Package Element
- Add parentID to child elements of package

[2012-oct-11]
MAXImporter:
- object.type & relationship.type may not be empty; if the xml tag is empty, use default

[2012-oct-09]
MAXImporter: all child elements of an object that start with "tag." will be placed as taggedvalue of that object
- in a single transaction; the Element.TaggedValues.GetByName doesnot work; so if there are multiple objects with the same id in one max.xml
- solved by calling Refresh on Element.TaggedValues

[2012-sep-12]
MAXExporter: initial
