HISTORY
=======
MAXExporter1 - uses the EA API through COM
MAXExporter2 - uses EA SQL XML calls (is somewhat faster)
MAXExporter3 - used xsd.exe to create a Class from the xsd

TODO
====
- MAXImporter: 
	- update of attributes gives "Action not supported" Exception
	- how to detect deletes of objects/relationships when updating?
	-- Suggestion from the CIC WG (sept-2013) is to add a column for this!
    - Known issue: Deeper than 1 nesting still could give problems.
- MAXExporter:
	- also support Diagrams -> Diagram serves as a selection of the elements to export!
	- cannot get "alias" of attributes in SQLXML?
	- ?? add option to export Markedup notes with xhtml namespace or XML escaped
	- Why is the required <name>-element not always created?
	- !! Handle special Composition and DirectedAssociation RelationshipTypes!
	- Ignored Object_Types are e.g. Boundary. Should we also ignore Text, Note? and NoteLink?
- MAXSchema:
	- sync UML model of schema (in EAP)!
	- fix namespace of all elements to "max:"
- Excel binding document, figure out multi tagged value binding; <tag><value><notes>
	- Q: Multiple tagged values with the same name result in multiple elements with the samen name, how to handle that in a spreadsheet?
	  A: Through an XSLT! <- see mail thread with Lorraine (23-oct-2013) for example

ISSUE!! EA uses system configured dateformat, DateFormat.Parse doesnot???
	Workaround: set system dateformat English (VS)
	Combinations tried: 
		Windows Language Dutch + Date Format: Dutch & English -> works
		Windows Language English + Date Format: Dutch doesnot work, English -> works

EA11 ISSUE. t_diagramlinks is empty if connectors are not touched. Workaround is to touch a connector.

EA BUG: EA.Element.Attributes.GetByName throws Exception when class has attributes

CHANGELOG
=========
[2015-oct-08]
MAXSchema,MAXExporter3
- Added attribute.id (raw id, should also use MAX::ID tagged value method, not used on import now, update by name)
- Implemented workaround for EA.Element.Attributes.GetByName EA Bug.

[2015-apr-17]
Util
- Added CurrentOutputPath and use it; requested by NICTIZ

[2015-apr-15]
MAXSchema
- Added ObjectTypes Boundary, Constraint and Artifact
MAXExporter3
- EXPORT ONLY: added Linked Document BASE64 encoded in notes element of object

[2014-sep-02]
MAXImporter3
- Now accept file extensions .xml and .max

[2014-jul-14]
MAXImporter3
- Used wrong id for packages, now use Package.Element.ElementID instead of PackageID

[2014-jun-20]
MAXExporter3
- Forgot to export tagged values for relationships.

[2014-jun-13]
MAXExporter3
- BUG: Sometimes an objectId is reported that cannot be accessed with Repository.GetElementById. Workaround by catching the Exception.

[2014-apr-29]
MAXExporter3,ExtensionMethods
- Gave ElementValueInt a defaultValue. EA VirtualDocuments attributes are of type Package which don't have a Const column.

[2014-apr-25]
MAXExporter3:
- 2x performance improvement!
  Notes for Objects now through SQL instead of via API. The column name was wrong, it is "Note" instead of "Notes"!!
  Export of 5500 items was 46s is now 27s.

[2014-apr-12]
MAXImporter3/Exporter3:
- Use MAX::ImportFile and MAX::ExportFile as defaults if present.
- Use Repository.GetContextXxx instead of Repository.GetTree*
 -- Now you can select a Package in a Diagram and export it.

[2014-mrt-06]
Util:
- Split FileName into Directory and FileName in Open File Dialog

[2014-feb-28]
MAXExporter3:
- Add ExportDate and ExportFile tagged values for exported package
MAXImporter3:
- Add ImportDate and ImportFile tagged values for imported package

[2014-feb-22]
MAXExporter3:
- Order of Packages and Objects in the MAX export is now sorted by the position they have in the Project Browser (TPos)

[2014-feb-19]
Main,MAXExporter3:
- Show output tab when there are issues
MAXSchema.xsd:
- Added "Issue", "Change", "Artifact" ObjectType
- Added "Usage" RelationshipType

[2014-feb-11]
MAXExporter3:
- Implemented export of objects in selected Diagram
MAXSchema.xsd:
- Added "Abstraction" RelationshipType

[2014-feb-05]
MAXSchema:
- Added "Activity" ObjectType

[2014-jan-29]
MAXSchema:
- MAJOR typo in "Realisation" Relationship 'z' :-( fixed. N.B. EA Uses 'z' in UI, but 's' in models.
MAXImporter3:
- Use StereotypeEx instead of without Ex. Now multiple stereotypes can be passed comma separated.
- On import/update the connectors were not deleted when using custom id's

[2014-jan-21]
MAXImporter3:
- Importing relationships now keeps relationships to objects outside the max file.
- Fixed: Before this you had to select a parent package for Update now works on selected package.
-- Import will create all objects below the selected package
-- Update will update all objects inclusive the selected package
-- Export will export all objects inclusive the selected package

[2014-jan-07]
MAXImporter3:
- The name of a Package cannot be empty on create.
  Workaround in code by creating with "_" as name and then change it back to empty string.

[2013-dec-20]
simplify-max-for-excel.xslt
- Simplify attributes and tags
- Also do tags for relationships

[2013-dec-19]
MAXImporter3:
- Forgot to handle tagged values for relationships. Fixed.
simplify-max-for-excel.xslt
- Renamed and added relationships
excel-to-full-max.xslt
- Initial, only do tag name and notes as <memo>

[2013-dec-13]
MAXExporter3:
- Forgot to set typeSpecified to true
- Elements outside selected package did not use MAX::ID, now they do

[2013-dec-01]
ProgressWindow:
- Refresh after setup and step, so progress gets updated

[2013-nov-29]
MAXImporter3:
- Split importing in 3 parts. First objects without parents, then objects with parents and check if the parent exists, then the leftover

[2013-nov-22]
MAXSchema.xsd:
- Added "Realization" and "InformationFlow" releationship types

[2013-nov-20]
MAXImporter3:
- Ignore empty object.parentId

[2013-nov-06]
MAXImporter3:
- Made more robust, e.g. skip maxObj where id=null and maxRel where sourceId=null || destId=null <- should be checked by the XSD!
- First import objects that have no parentId and then the ones that do. 
  This makes the import less reliant on the order of the objects when nesting is used.

[2013-oct-25]
XML Transforms/flatten-max-for-excel.xslt:
- Added XML Transform to flatten deep attributes & tags for easy import in Excel.
MAXExporter3:
- If object notes is empty then don't include empty notes element
- object type was missing in export because forgot to set typeSpecified

[2013-oct-21]
MAXDiff:
- Initial version
MAXSchema:
- Removed default value for type. Now we can recognize absent element.
MAXImporter3:
- Handle default Object Type (=Class) in code. We can now differentiate between absent element.
  Not setting type in an update means "dont change".

[2013-sep-26]
MAXImproter3/MAXExporter3: Applied some Resharper suggestions.
MAXExporter3:
- Added start of export from Diagram in Comments!

[2013-sep-23]
- Moved some paths to "C:\Temp" instead of "D:\"
MAXExporter3:
- EA uses system configured dateformat. Try both CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture via try/catch workaround

[2013-jul-17]
MAXExporter3:
- Ignore ObjectType and RelationshipTypes that are not in the XSD

[2013-jul-13]
MAXImporter3:
- More robust import for Package with ParentID
- eaPackageDict was not constructed with correct ID
- MAX::ID overrules ElementID when constructing eaElementDict, not both!

[2013-jul-11]
MAXImporter3:
- More robust count. Code expected at least the objects AND relationships tags.

[2013-jul-01]
MAXSchema.xsd
- Added RelationshipType enum "Package" used for "<import>"
MAXExporter3:
- Forgot object@abstract & attribute@isReadOnly _Specified_
- relationship@sourceLabel, @destLabel

[2013-jun-30]
MAXImporter3:
- Return bool if there were any issues.

[2013-jun-23]
MAXImporter/MAXExporter/MAXExporter2
- removed, really old now
MAXImporter3/Exporter3/MAXSchema
- create and use MAXSchema model using XSD.exe
- also now import attribute tags!

[2013-jun-21]
MAXExporter2:
- default filename based on package name + ".max.xml"
- add export of package tagged values, attributes & attribute tagged values
- add cardinalities & labels for relationships
MAXModel:
- add attributes + tagged values
- add cardinalities & labels for relationships
MAXSchema:
- add tagged values for attributes

[2013-jun-14]
MAXImporter,Input/MAXSchema.xsd:
- object@isAbstract, attribute@isReadOnly, attribute@alias

[2013-jun-13]
Input/MAXSchema.xsd:
- relationship/id is optional and not used at the moment
- added optional attribute@minCard/@maxCard
- added optional relationship@sourceLabel,@sourceCard,@destLabel,@destCard
MAXImporter:
- dont use XPathSelect, just use Element/Elements for minor speed improvement
- added optional attribute cardinality and relationship labels and cardinality
- BUG FIXED: parentId was case sensitive and should not be

[2013-may-07]
MAXExporter2:
- Made it more robust by adding and using Extension Methods to XElement that check for null.

[2013-apr-24]
MAXExporter2:
- Package_ID and Object_ID are 2 idspace. So there can be an Package with id=5 and an object with id=5.
  In EA a Package has both ID's. MAX has only one idspace and therefore has to use Object_ID. Fixed.
ProgressWindow:
- on-top of parent instead of on-top of all.
MAXImporter:
- Also set Package TreePos!

[2013-apr-18]
MAXExporter2:
- Repository.EnableCache to speedup export!

[2013-apr-12]
MAXExporter2:
- join t_package and t_object reliable on ea_guid instead of unreliable Name
  ea_guid is the same for the Package and its Element

[2013-mrt-28]
MAXImporter:
- Replaced "\n" to "\r\n" == newline in EA notes!

[2013-mrt-26]
MAXImporter/MAXSchema.xsd:
- Implemented attributes
- Relationship type Composition -> Closed Aggregation
- Keep order of objects and attributes in Project Browser (using Element.TreePos, Attribute.Pos)

[2013-mrt-19]
MAXImporter:
- Also import Packages and new tag format
MAXExporter2:
- Stereotype of object can be NULL, check for that.
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>
MAXExporter:
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>

[2013-mrt-15/16/17]
QuickAccessViewControl:
- Added Quick Access Buttons View!
MAXExporter2:
- Reimplementation of the MAX Exporter using the SQLQuery interface to the UML Model.
- Keep HTML formatting as unescaped XML in the Package and Element notes. Not for TaggedValues since no formatting is allowed there.
- Add "exportDate" attribute to model element.
- Added selected package

[2013-mrt-13]
MAXExporter/Importer:
- Tagged values in repeating child "tag" element with name, value and notes childs. If you want to use in spreadsheet, use a transform.
- MaxExporter: experimental add attribute child elements.
- MAXExporter: export in background thread

[2013-mrt-06]
-- Separated MAX classes from UMCG_EA_AddIn.

[2013-mrt-06]
MAXExporter:
- on export add/update MAX::LastExportDate tag to exported package
MAXImporter:
- on import add/update MAX::LastImportDate tag to imported package

[2013-feb-27]
MAXExporter/Importer/xsd:
- added optional "Element.modified" property to object

[2012-nov-21]
MAXExporter:
- For now replace ':' in Tagged Values with a '_'

[2012-nov-19]
MAXSchema.xsd:
- added alias attribute of object
MAXExporter:
- Add support from Package (for all Elements) and Diagram to filter Elements
- Include parentId for nested Elements
- Include Package Element
- Add parentID to child elements of package

[2012-oct-11]
MAXImporter:
- object.type & relationship.type may not be empty; if the xml tag is empty, use default

[2012-oct-09]
MAXImporter: all child elements of an object that start with "tag." will be placed as taggedvalue of that object
- in a single transaction; the Element.TaggedValues.GetByName doesnot work; so if there are multiple objects with the same id in one max.xml
- solved by calling Refresh on Element.TaggedValues

[2012-sep-12]
MAXExporter: initial
