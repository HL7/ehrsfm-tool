CHANGELOG
=========
[2015-nov-20]
R2ProfileCompiler
- Implemented workaround for new functions.
	* Dependency with Generalization/Aggregation-stereotype is used as Work-around 
	* for Package Generalization/Aggregation (which is not possible / allowed in UML).

[2015-may-15]
"Section Compiler Instruction is a Class, base element is a Package. 
 Generalization is not possible between Package and Class. Workaround by using Dependency with Generalization Stereotype implemented."
R2Config
- Added PHR categories and colors
Main
- Added open of Section Form for Section Compiler Instruction
R2ModelV2EA,ProfilingForm
- Added handling of Section Compiler Instruction
- Added criteria count to name in views
SectionForm
- Added editing of Section Compiler Instruction
R2ProfileCompiler
- Added Section Compiler Instruction

[2015-jan-22/feb-03]
Project
- Updated .Net to v4.0 and removed "install prerequisites"
Main
- Double click on <HL7-FM-Profile> gave unwanted exception. Fixed.

[2014-dec-13]
R2ProfileCompiler
- New nodes could have no tags, e.g. for ExternalReferences. This broke the compiler. Checked.

[2014-nov-28] Notes of Testing
R2ModelV2EA
- Factory now sets ProfileDefinition property for all CompilerInstructions! Needed for Priority.
MDG
- Updated Learning Center URLs
Schematron
- Update Profile validation

[2014-nov-28]
ProfilingForm
- Moved sync "<->" buttons.
- Sync button did not do anything for non compiler instructions. Fixed.
R2ProfileCompiler
- Merged Profile generated GUID's as ID's for Compiler Instructions. The compiler did not expect that on some places.
- Testing7: When a Criterion is in the profiledef and his Function is not, but his Function has ConsequenceLinks, 
	  the ConsequenceLinks Functions were not included in the compiled profile. Fixed.
	  WORKAROUND was: Include the Function.
ProfileDefinition/FunctionForm/CriterionForm
- Priorities Definition accepts special format <PRIO>"<space>-<space>"<Prio Description> lines will add PRIO's to Priority Choice in Function and Criteria Forms.
  e.g. "EF2015 - Essential Future in 2015" will add "EF2015" to the possible list of Priorities.
- Also shows Priorities Definition in Tooltip
R2Validator
- Schematron filenames were wrong.
- Not all issues are associated to an Element that caused an Exception. Fixed.
MergeProfilesForm
- Removed load of dummy profile
- Start empty, disable select,clear,load,save buttons and double click
- Edit Priority in Merged Profile Elements threw Exception

[2014-nov-21]
R2ProfileCompiler
- When new element has multiple Aggregation relationships it was included multiple times. Now compiler detects this and warns.
- New Childs of new Elements were not added if they came before the new parent Element was in the MAX file. Fixed by creating placeholders.
- Made the output a bit quieter. Added DEBUG level and leave out DEBUG in MSI.
ProfilingForm
- Made more robust. Give feedback if model is not the way we expect.
-- 1 When there are multiple base elements associated to the compiler instruction or vise-verse.
-- 2 when there is no base element associated with a compiler instruction.
- Added tooltips.

[2014-nov-19]
R2ProfileCompiler
- ChangeIndicator was set to Changed instead of New for new elements. Fixed.
