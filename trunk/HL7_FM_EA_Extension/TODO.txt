- LOW: [ ] Sometimes style is not updated e.g. when Optionality changes
- LOW: [ ] Sync Reference tagged value <-> Relationship
- LOW: [ ] MergeProfiles: Add function to align elements that have no base, based on their id
- LOW: [ ] MergeProfiles: Add function to connect merged element to base model based on id
- LOW: [ ] Move R2ModelElement.Priority up one abstract class, now Priority is also in Model/Profile/ProfileDefinition
- LOW: [ ] R2ModelMax update lastModified when any field is modified
- LOW: [ ] Move EAHelper in R2ModelEA
- LOW: [ ] Use ModelViewController SourceObject = R2Model for DataGrid e.d.
- LOW: [ ] IsReadOnly should have effect on SaveObject
- LOW: [ ] Make ProfilingForm work on Base.R2ModelElement so that we can test it without EA
- [ ] MergeProfilesForm Implement Smart Sorting
- LOW: [/] Finalize: OutputListener add ID of element so DoubleClick in EAOutputConsole brings you to associated element
- LOW: [ ] On Compile check path and give proper message instead of Exception
- LOW: [ ] Update the Quick Access Tab
- LOW: [ ] Implement R2ModelV2EAXML <- work on SQL XML query
- LOW: [ ] Update the FM Browser Tab
-- + show ConsequenceLinks
-- + Make it work on R2ModelV2EAXML
-- + Make it use Element.Elements
-- + Smart sort!
- LOW: [ ] Use Controls instead of Forms
- LOW: [ ] Figure out how to link Output Console lines to related Element when they have GUID's instead of ID's (see FMTreeNode.instrID)
- LOW: [ ] ProfilingForm / Criteria List doesnot size

- [ ] Tagged values are duplicated when max file is imported and EA has UML Profile loaded.
-- Workaround could be to remove the UML Profile.
- [ ] MergeProfiles: New functions/criteria add using Aggregation to parent. Also don't forget to include the parent Aggregation in "<< Select"

Missing / Incomplete
- [ ] External References functionality
- [ ] Signing of MSI with HL7 cert (tamara @ HL7.org)
- [ ] Consequence Links pre and postfixed with "[[" and "]]" in text for publication, not recognized in Extension
- [ ] Integrate Profile Comparison XSLT in Extension? Or in Manual?

FM R2 Issues
- CPS.2.1#09
  <notes>The system SHOULD conform to TI.1.5 (Non-Repudiation) and TI.1.6 (Secure Data Exchange) when importing/receiving both structured and unstructured data.</notes>
  This should result in 2 ConsequenceLinks, now the code and validator only expects 0..1 and never "... and ..."
- TI.2.1 Links to self (see GraphViz)
