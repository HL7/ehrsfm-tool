		<Name>Direct Care</Name>
		<Alias>DC</Alias>
		<Description>Direct care EHR-S functions are the subset of EHR-S functions that enable delivery of healthcare and offer clinical decision support.</Description>
		<Example>
      For example, when a child presents with symptoms of common cold, a Direct Care EHR-S
      Function will enable the doctor to record that event.  Additionally, Clinical decision-support functions within the Direct Care EHR-S section will alert the provider that a vaccination is due and will offer contraindication alerts for the medication given to the child who has symptoms of a cold.
    </Example>
		<Actors>The principal users of these functions are expected to be authorized healthcare providers; the patient and/or subject of care will have access to certain functions to view, update or make corrections to their Electronic Health Record.  The provider will receive appropriate decision support, as well as support from the EHR-S to enable effective electronic communication between providers, and between the provider and the patient/parent/caregiver.</Actors>

			<Name>Care Management</Name>
			<Description>
        Care Management functions (i.e. DC.1.x functions) are those directly used by providers as they deliver patient care and create an electronic health record.  DC.1.1.x functions address the mechanics of creating a health record and concepts such as a single logical health record, managing patient demographics, and managing externally generated (including patient originated) health data.  Thereafter, functions DC.1.2.x through DC.1.9.x follow a fairly typical flow of patient care activities and corresponding data, starting with managing the patient history and progressing through consents, assessments, care plans, orders, results etc.

        Integral to these care management activities is an underlying system foundation that maintains the privacy, security, and integrity of the captured health information – the information infrastructure of the EHR-S.   Throughout the DC functions, conformance criteria formalize the relationships to Information Infrastructure functions.  Criteria that apply to all DC.1 functions are listed in this header (see Conformance Clause page six for discussion of “inherited” conformance criteria).

        In the Direct Care functions there are times when actions/activities related to "patients" are also applicable to the patient representative.  Therefore, in this section, the term “patient” could refer to the patient and/or the patient’s personal representative (e.g. guardian, surrogate).</Description>

					<Name>Identify and Maintain a Patient Record</Name>
					<Statement>Identify and maintain a single patient record for each patient.</Statement>
					<Description>A single record is needed for legal purposes, as well as to organize it unambiguously for the provider.  Health information is captured and linked to the patient record.  Static data elements as well as data elements that will change over time are maintained.  The patient is uniquely identified, after which the record is tied to that patient.  Combining information on the same patient, or separating information where it was inadvertently captured for the wrong patient, helps maintain health information for a single patient.  In the process of creating a patient record, it is at times advantageous to replicate identical information across multiple records, so that such data does not have to be re-entered.  For example, when a parent registers children as new patients, the address, guarantor, and insurance data may be propagated in the children’s records without having to re-enter them.</Description>

						<Description>
              It is critically important to be able to distinguish patient-originated data that is either provided or entered by a patient from clinically authenticated data. Patients may provide data for entry into the health record or be given a mechanism for entering this data directly. Patient-originated data intended for use by providers will be available for their use.
              Data about the patient may be appropriately provided by:
              1.  the patient
              2.  a surrogate (parent, spouse, guardian) or
              3.  an informant (teacher, lawyer, case worker).
              An electronic health record may provide the ability for direct data entry by any of these.

              Patient-originated data may also be captured by devices and transmitted for inclusion into the electronic health record.
              Data entered by any of these must be stored with source information.  A provider must authenticate patient-originated data included in the patient’s legal health record.</Description>

						<Description>
              It is critically important to be able to distinguish patient health data derived from administrative or financial data from clinically authenticated data.
              Sources of administrative and financial data relating to a patient’s health may provide this data for entry into the health record or be given a mechanism for entering this data directly.  The data must be explicitly labeled as derived from administrative or financial data, and information about the source must be linked with that data.
              Patient health data that is derived from administrative or financial data may be provided by:
              1.  the patient
              2.  a provider
              3.  a payer, or
              4.  entities that transmit or process administrative or financial data.

              Since this data is non-clinical, it may not be authenticated for inclusion in the patient’s legal health record.  Registration data, which may contain demographic data and pertinent positive and negative histories, is an example of administrative and financial data that may be captured.</Description>

					<Description>Different medication orders, including discontinue, refill, and renew, require different levels and kinds of detail, as do medication orders placed in different situations. The correct details are recorded for each situation. Administration or patient instructions are available for selection by the ordering clinicians, or the ordering clinician is facilitated in creating such instructions.  The system may allow for the creation of common content for prescription details. Appropriate time stamps for all medication related activity are generated. This includes series of orders that are part of a therapeutic regimen, e.g. Renal Dialysis, Oncology. 
When a clinician places an order for a medication, that order may or may not comply with a formulary specific to the patient’s location or insurance coverage, if applicable. Whether the order complies with the formulary should be communicated to the ordering clinician at an appropriate point to allow the ordering clinician to decide whether to continue with the order. Formulary-compliant alternatives to the medication being ordered may also be presented.</Description>

						<Description>The clinician is alerted to drug-drug, drug-allergy, and drug-food interactions at levels appropriate to the health care setting and with respect to the patient condition. These alerts may be customized to suit the user or group.
If the patient's condition is one where, in order to view the necessary components of the health record, patient authorization or consent is required, then the system should show the medication but mask the condition for which the medication is prescribed until the required consent or authorization is available.   In an emergent situation, where all health information is required to provide the most effective treatment, and it is not possible to obtain  an authorization or consent, the system should provide an override function to allow access to  the diagnosis or problem for which a medication was ordered.  This may vary based on jurisdictional law.</Description>

					<Description>Standardized surveillance performance measures that are based on known patterns of disease presentation can be identified by aggregating data from multiple input mechanisms. For example, elements include, but are not limited to patient demographics, resource utilization, presenting symptoms, acute treatment regimens, laboratory and imaging study orders and results and genomic and proteomic data elements. Identification of known patterns of existing diseases involves aggregation and analysis of these data elements by existing relationships. However, the identification of new patterns of disease requires more sophisticated pattern recognition analysis. Early recognition of new patterns requires data points available early in the disease presentation. Demographics, ordering patterns and resource use (e.g., ventilator or intensive care utilization pattern changes) are often available earlier in the presentation of non-predictable diseases. Consumer-generated information is also valuable with respect to surveillance efforts.</Description>

1.	Identify and notify individual care providers or care managers that a risk has been identified and requires attention; and 
2.	Provide suggestions on the appropriate course of action.
A care provider now has the ability to decide how patients are notified, if necessary.
For example, this function may be used after detection of a local outbreak of hepatitis A, advising providers of the at-risk population and potential prophylactic treatment. 
A second example might be the dissemination of new care guidelines for elderly patients with a specific chronic disease.

				<Name>Clinical Workflow Tasking</Name>
				<Statement>Schedule and manage tasks with appropriate timeliness.</Statement>
				<Description>Since the electronic health record will replace the paper chart, tasks that were based on the paper artifact must be effectively managed in the electronic environment. Functions must exist in the EHR-S that support electronically any workflow that previously depended on the existence of a physical artifact (such as the paper chart, a phone message slip) in a paper based system. Tasks differ from other more generic communication among participants in the care process because they are a call to action and target completion of a specific workflow in the context of a patient's health record (including a specific component of the record). Tasks also require disposition (final resolution). The initiator may optionally require a response. For example, in a paper based system, physically placing charts in piles for review creates a physical queue of tasks related to those charts. This queue of tasks (for example, a set of patient phone calls to be returned) must be supported electronically so that the list (of patients to be called) is visible to the appropriate user or role for disposition. Tasks are time-limited (or finite). The state transition (e.g. created, performed and resolved) may be managed by the user explicitly or automatically based on rules. For example, if a user has a task to signoff on a test result, that task should automatically be marked complete by the EHR when the test result linked to the task is signed in the system. Patients will become more involved in the care process by receiving tasks related to their care. Examples of patient related tasks include acknowledgement of receipt of a test result forwarded from the provider, or a request to schedule an appointment for a pap smear (based on age and frequency criteria) generated automatically by the EHR-S on behalf of the provider.</Description>

					<Name>Clinical Task Assignment and Routing</Name>
					<Statement>Assignment, delegation and/or transmission of tasks to the appropriate parties.</Statement>
					<Description>Tasks are at all times assigned to at least one user or role for disposition. Whether the task is assignable and to whom the task can be assigned will be determined by the specific needs of practitioners in a care setting. Task-assignment lists help users prioritize and complete assigned tasks. For example, after receiving communication (e.g. a phone call or e-mail) from a patient, the triage nurse routes or assigns a task to return the patient's call to the physician who is on call. Task creation and assignment may be automated, where appropriate. An example of a system-triggered task is when lab results are received electronically; a task to review the result is automatically generated and assigned to a clinician. Task assignment ensures that all tasks are disposed of by the appropriate person or role and allows efficient interaction of entities in the care process.</Description>

        <Statement></Statement>
				<Description>Healthcare requires secure communications among various participants: patients, doctors, nurses, chronic disease care managers, pharmacies, laboratories, payers, consultants, and etcetera. An effective EHRS supports communication across all relevant participants, reduces the overhead and costs of healthcare-related communications, and provides automatic tracking and reporting. The list of communication participants is determined by the care setting and may change over time. Because of concerns about scalability of the specification over time, communication participants for all care settings or across care settings are not enumerated here because it would limit the possibilities available to each care setting and implementation. However, communication between providers and between patients and providers will be supported in all appropriate care settings and across care settings. Implementation of the EHRS enables new and more effective channels of communication, significantly improving efficiency and patient care. The communication functions of the EHRS will eventually change the way participants collaborate and distribute the work of patient care.</Description>

					<Name>Support for Provider-Pharmacy Communication</Name>
					<Statement>Provide features to enable secure bi-directional communication of information electronically between practitioners and pharmacies or between practitioner and intended recipient of pharmacy orders.</Statement>
					<Description>When a medication is prescribed, the order is routed to the pharmacy or other intended recipient of pharmacy orders. This information is used to avoid transcription errors and facilitate detection of potential adverse reactions. If there is a question from the pharmacy, that communication can be presented to the provider with their other tasks.
The transmission of prescription data between systems should conform to realm acceptable messaging standards.  As an example, specific standards in the United States include the most recent versions of criteria from Health Level 7 (HL7), X12N, and/or the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP); and those of the National Electronic Claims Standard (NeCST) in Canada.  It is anticipated that other realms may list other acceptable messaging standards.  These messaging standards might be generic clinical communication standards, internationally agreed pharmacy messages, or nationally defined messages.

Informative examples:
- HL7 Clinical Document Architecture Release 2
- ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record Communication
- CEN ENV 13607:2000. Health informatics. Messages for the exchange of information on medicine prescriptions
- X12N healthcare transactions

Supportive EHR-S also provide input to systems that perform medical research, promote public health, and seek to improve the quality of healthcare delivered.</Description>
		<Example>For example, during the encounter, Supportive EHR-S functions will electronically query local immunization registries (to insure that the child is currently registered), and will determine the child’s immunization status.  After treatment, Supportive EHR-S functions will report any immunization to an immunization registry and will provide any encounter data required by financial and administrative systems.</Example>

Providers and administrators also need to query for the absence of specific clinical or administrative data. For example, the Quality Control department may be reviewing whether or not the protocol for management of Diabetes Mellitus is being followed.

		<Name>Information Infrastructure</Name>
		<Alias>IN</Alias>
		<Description>The Information Infrastructure section consists of common functions that support the Direct Care and Supportive Functions.  Information Infrastructure functions are not involved in the provision of healthcare, but are necessary to ensure that the EHR-S provides necessary safeguards for patient safety, privacy and information security, as well as operational efficiencies and minimum standards for interoperability. They may be provided by the applications that support managing the health record, supporting infrastructure or a combination of both.</Description>
		<Example>For example, Direct Care and Supportive EHR-S functions must operate in a secure environment.  Therefore, Information Infrastructure functions will provide a secure electronic environment for the immunization registration query mentioned previously and will report the child’s immunization event in a secure manner.  Information Infrastructure functions will also transparently provide other essential services, such as the archival and backup of the child’s record and an audit trail of all accesses to the child’s record.</Example>
		<Actors>The functions are expected to be performed transparently by EHR-S applications on behalf of EHR-S end-users.  The System Administrator is expected to be involved in all operations related to configuring and managing the EHR-S operation.  A security administrator is the person responsible for implementing security policy for authentication, authorization, and access control.</Actors>

			<Description>To enforce security, all EHR-S applications must adhere to the rules established to control access and protect the privacy of EHR information. Security measures assist in preventing unauthorized use of data and protect against loss, tampering and destruction.  An EHR-S must be capable of including or interfacing with standards-conformant security services to ensure that any Principal (user, organization, device, application, component, or object) accessing the system or its data is appropriately authenticated, authorized and audited in conformance with local and/or jurisdictional policies.

				<Name>Entity Authorization.</Name>
				<Statement>Manage the sets of access-control permissions granted to entities that use an EHR-S (EHR-S Users). 

Enable EHR-S security administrators to grant authorizations to users, for roles, and within contexts. A combination of these authorization categories may be applied to control access to EHR-S functions or data within an EHR-S, including at the application or the operating system level.</Statement>
				<Description>EHR S Users are authorized to use the components of an EHR-S according to their identity, role, work-assignment, location and/or the patient’s present condition and the EHR S User’s scope of practice within a legal jurisdiction. 

- User based authorization refers to the permissions granted or denied based on the identity of an individual. An example of User based authorization is a patient defined denial of access to all or part of a record to a particular party for privacy related reasons. Another user based authorization is for a tele-monitor device or robotic access to an EHR-S for prescribed directions and other input. 

- Role based authorization refers to the responsibility or function performed in a particular operation or process. Example roles include: an application or device (tele-monitor or robotic); or a nurse, dietician, administrator, legal guardian, and auditor. 

- Context-based Authorization is defined by ISO 10181-3 Technical Framework for Access Control Standard as security-relevant properties of the context in which an access request occurs, explicitly time, location, route of access, and quality of authentication. For example, an EHR-S might only allow supervising providers’ context authorization to attest to entries proposed by residents under their supervision. 

In addition to the ISO standard, context authorization for an EHR-S is extended to satisfy special circumstances such as, work assignment, patient consents and authorizations, or other healthcare-related factors. A context-based example is a patient-granted authorization to a specific third party for a limited period to view specific EHR records.

Another example is a right granted for a limited period to view those, and only those, EHR records connected to a specific topic of investigation.</Description>

				<Description>An EHR-S allows data entry and data access to a patient's electronic health record and it can be a sender or receiver of healthcare information.  Non repudiation guarantees that the source of the data record can not later deny that it is the source; that the sender or receiver of a message cannot later deny having sent or received the message. For example, non-repudiation may be achieved through the use of a:
- Digital signature, which serves as a unique identifier for an individual (much like a written signature on a paper document).
- Confirmation service, which utilizes a message transfer agent to create a digital receipt (providing confirmation that a message was sent and/or received) and 
- Timestamp, which proves that a document existed at a certain date and time.  Date and Time stamping implies the ability to indicate the time zone where it was recorded (time zones are described in ISO 8601 Standard Time Reference).</Description>

				<Name>Secure Data Routing</Name>
				<Statement>Route electronically exchanged EHR data only to/from known, registered, and authenticated destinations/sources (according to applicable healthcare-specific rules and relevant standards).</Statement>
				<Description>An EHR-S needs to ensure that it is exchanging EHR information with the entities (applications, institutions, directories) it expects. This function depends on entity authorization and authentication to be available in the system. For example, a physician practice management application in an EHR-S might send claim attachment information to an external entity. To accomplish this, the application must use a secure routing method, which ensures that both the sender and receiving sides are authorized to engage in the information exchange.  Known sources and destinations can be established in a static setup or they can be dynamically determined.  Examples of a static setup are recordings of IP addresses or recordings of DNS names.  For dynamic determination of known sources and destinations systems can use authentication mechanisms as described in IN.1.1.  For example, the sending of a lab order from the EHRS to a lab system within the same organization usually uses a simple static setup for routing. In contrast sending a lab order to a reference lab outside of the organization will involve some kind of authentication process.
In general, when the underlying network infrastructure is secure (e.g. secure LAN or VPN) the simple static setup is used.</Description>

Violations or potential violations can impose tangible economic or social losses on affected patients, as well as less tangible feelings of vulnerability and pain.   Fear of potential violations discourages patients from revealing sensitive personal information that may be relevant to diagnostic and treatment services.  Rules for the protection of privacy and confidentiality may vary depending upon the vulnerability of patients and the sensitivity of records.  Strongest protections should apply to the records of minors and the records of patients with stigmatized conditions.  Authorization to access the most sensitive parts of an EHR is most definitive if made by the explicit and specific consent of the patient.

				<Name>Auditable Records</Name>
				<Statement>Provide audit capabilities for system access and usage indicating the author, the modification (where pertinent), and the date and time at which a record was created, modified, viewed, extracted, or deleted.  Date and Time stamping implies the ability to indicate the time zone where it was recorded (time zones are described in ISO 8601 Standard Time Reference).  Auditable records extend to information exchange, to audit of consent status management (to support DC.1.3.3) and to entity authentication attempts. Audit functionality includes the ability to generate audit reports and to interactively view change history for individual health records or for an EHR-S.</Statement>
				<Description>Audit functionality extends to security audits, data audits, audits of data exchange, and the ability to generate audit reports. Audit capability settings should be configurable to meet the needs of local policies. Examples of audited areas include: 

- Security audit, which logs access attempts and resource usage including user login, file access, other various activities, and whether any actual or attempted security violations occurred
- Data audit, which records who, when, and by which system an EHR record was created, updated, translated, viewed, extracted, or (if local policy permits) deleted. Audit-data may refer to system setup data or to clinical and patient management data

- Information exchange audit, which records data exchanges between EHR-S applications (for example, sending application; the nature, history, and content of the information exchanged); and information about data transformations (for example, vocabulary translations, reception event details, etc.)

- Audit reports should be flexible and address various users' needs. For example, a legal authority may want to know how many patients a given healthcare provider treated while the provider's license was suspended. Similarly, in some cases a report detailing all those who modified or viewed a certain patient record

- Security audit trails and data audit trails are used to verify enforcement of business, data integrity, security, and access-control rules

-There is a requirement for system audit trails for the following events:
>Loading new versions of, or changes to, the clinical system;
>Loading new versions of codes and knowledge bases;
>Taking and restoring of backup;
>Changing the date and time where the clinical system allows this to be done;
>Archiving any data; 
>Re-activating of an archived patient record;
>Entry to and exiting from the clinical system; 
>Remote access connections including those for system support and maintenance activities</Description>

				<Statement>Store and manage health record information as structured and unstructured data</Statement>
				<Description>Unstructured health record information is information that is not divided into discrete fields AND not represented as numeric, enumerated or codified data. 

General examples of unstructured health record information include:
- text
- word processing document
- image
- multimedia

Specific examples include:
- text message to physician
- patient photo
- letter from family
- scanned image of insurance card
- dictated report (voice recording)

Structured health record information is divided into discrete fields, and may be enumerated, numeric or codified.

Examples of structured health information include: 
- patient address (non-codified, but discrete field)
- diastolic blood pressure (numeric) 
- coded result observation
- coded diagnosis
- patient risk assessment questionnaire with multiple-choice answers

Context may determine whether or not data are unstructured, e.g., a progress note might be standardized and structured in some EHR-S (e.g., Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan) but unstructured in others.

Managing healthcare data includes capture, retrieval, deletion, correction, amendment, and augmentation.  Augmentation refers to providing additional information regarding the healthcare data, which is not part of the data itself, e.g. linking patient consents or authorizations to the healthcare data of the patient.</Description>

			<Description>Registry and directory service functions are critical to successfully managing the security, interoperability, and the consistency of the health record data across an EHR-S. These services enable the linking of relevant information across multiple information sources within, or external to, an EHR-S for use within an application.

Directories and registries support communication between EHR Systems and may be organized hierarchically or in a federated fashion. For example, a patient being treated by a primary care physician for a chronic condition may become ill while out of town. The new provider’s EHR-S interrogates a local, regional, or national registry to find the patient’s previous records. From the primary care record, a remote EHR-S retrieves relevant information in conformance with applicable patient privacy and confidentiality rules. 

An example of local registry usage is an EHR-S application sending a query message to the Hospital Information System to retrieve a patient's demographic data.</Description>

			<Name>Standard Terminologies and Terminology Services</Name>
			<Statement>Support semantic interoperability through the use of standard terminologies, standard terminology models and standard terminology services.</Statement>
			<Description>The purpose of supporting terminology standards and services is to enable semantic interoperability. Interoperability is demonstrated by the consistency of human and machine interpretation of shared data and reports. It includes the capture and support of consistent data for templates and decision support logic.

Terminology standards pertain to concepts, representations, synonyms, relationships and computable (machine-readable) definitions. Terminology services provide a common way for managing and retrieving these items.</Description>
			<Function>
				<ID>IN.4.1</ID>
				<Type>F</Type>
				<Name>Standard Terminologies and Terminology Models</Name>
				<Statement>Employ standard terminologies to ensure data correctness and to enable semantic interoperability (both within an enterprise and externally).

Support a formal standard terminology model.</Statement>
				<Description>Semantic interoperability requires standard terminologies combined with a formal standard information model.

A terminology provides semantic and computable identity to its concepts.  

Terminologies are use-case dependent and may or may not be realm dependent. For example, terminologies for public health interoperability may differ from those for healthcare quality, administrative reporting, research, etc.

Formal standard terminology models enable common semantic representations by describing relationships that exist between concepts within a terminology or in different terminologies, such as exemplified in the model descriptions contained in the HL7 Common Terminology Services specification.
The clinical use of standard terminologies is greatly enhanced with the ability to perform hierarchical inference searches across coded concepts. Hierarchical Inference enables searches to be conducted across sets of coded concepts stored in an EHR-S. Relationships between concepts in the terminology are used in the search to recognize child concepts of a common parent. For example, there may be a parent concept, "penicillin containing preparations" which has numerous child concepts, each of which represents a preparation containing a specific form of penicillin (Penicillin V, Penicillin G, etc). Therefore, a search may be conducted to find all patients taking any form of penicillin preparation.

Clinical and other terminologies may be provided through a terminology service internal or external to an EHR-S. An example of a terminology service is described in the HL7 Common Terminology Services specification.  

Informative examples of other HL7 and non-HL7 standards include:  

Standard information models:
- HL7 Clinical Document Architecture Release 2
- ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record Communication

Standard terminologies:

Such changes need to be cascaded to clinical content embedded in templates, custom formularies, etc., as determined by local policy.</Statement>
				<Description>Version control allows for multiple sets or versions of the same terminology to exist and be distinctly recognized over time. 
Terminology standards are usually periodically updated, and concurrent use of different versions may be required.  Since the meaning of a concept can change over time, it is important that retrospective analysis and research maintains the ability to relate changing conceptual meanings.  If the terminology encoding for a concept changes over time, it is also important that retrospective analysis and research can correlate the different encodings to ensure the permanence of the concept.  This does not necessarily imply that complete older versions of the terminology be kept in the EHR-S, only access to the changes needs to be maintained.

It should be possible to retire deprecated versions when applicable business cycles are completed while maintaining obsolescent code sets. An example use of this is for possible claims adjustment throughout the claim's lifecycle.</Description>

			<Description>Interoperability standards enable an EHR-S to operate as a set of applications. This results in a unified view of the system where the reality is that several disparate systems may be coming together.

				<Statement>Support the ability to operate seamlessly with other systems, either internal or external, that adhere to recognized interchange standards. “Other systems” include other EHR Systems, applications within an EHR-S, or other authorized entities that interact with an EHR-S.</Statement>
				<Description>An organization typically uses a number of interchange standards to meet its external and internal interoperability requirements. It is fundamental that there be a common understanding of rules regarding connectivity, information structures, formats and semantics.  These are known as “interoperability or interchange standards”.  Data exchange which may be between internal systems or modules, or external to the organization, is to occur in a manner which is seamless to the user.  For example, if data interchange involves double entry, or manual cut-and-paste steps by the user, it is not considered seamless.
Representation of EHR content is transmitted in a variety of interchange formats such as: HL7 Messages, Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and other HL7 Structured Documents, X12N healthcare transactions, and Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format.

Support for multiple interaction modes is needed to respond to differing levels of immediacy and types of exchange. For example, messaging is effective for many near-real time, asynchronous data exchange scenarios but may not be appropriate if the end-user is requesting an immediate response from a remote application. 

A variety of interaction modes are typically supported such as:
- Unsolicited Notifications, e.g. a patient has arrived for a clinic appointment
- Query/Response e.g., Is Adam Everyman known to the system?  Yes, MRN is 12345678.
- Service Request and Response, e.g., Laboratory Order for “Fasting Blood Sugar” and a response containing the results of the test.
- Information Interchange between organizations (e.g. in a RHIO, or in a National Health System) 
- Structured/discrete clinical documents, e.g., Clinical Note
- Unstructured clinical document, e.g., dictated surgical note

Standard terminology is a fundamental part of interoperability and is described in section IN.4.  Using a formal explicit information model further optimizes interoperability. An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). Organizations typically need to deal with more than one information model and may need to develop a mapping or a meta-model.</Description>

				<Name>Interchange Standards Versioning and Maintenance</Name>
				<Statement>Enable version control according to local policies to ensure maintenance of utilized interchange standards.
Version control of an interchange standard implementation includes the ability to accommodate changes as the source interchange standard undergoes its natural update process.</Statement>
				<Description>The life cycle of any given standard usually results from changes to its requirements.  It is critical that an organization know the version of any given standard it uses and what its requirements and capabilities are.

For example, if the organization migrates to an HL7 v2.5 messaging standard, it may choose to take advantage of new capabilities such as specimen or blood bank information.  The organization may find that certain fields have been retained for backwards compatibility only or withdrawn altogether.  The EHR-S needs to be able to handle all of these possibilities.

Standards typically evolve in such a way as to protect backwards compatibility. On the other hand, sometimes there is little, or no, backwards compatibility when an organization may need to replace an entire standard with a new methodology. An example of this is migrating from HL7 v2 to HL7 v3.

Interchange standards that are backward compatible support exchange among senders and receivers who are using different versions.  Version control ensures that those sending information in a later version of a standard consider the difference in information content that can be interchanged effectively with receivers, who are capable of processing only earlier versions. That is, senders need to be aware of the information that receivers are unable to capture and adjust their business processes accordingly.
Version control enables multiple versions of the same interchange standard to exist and be distinctly recognized over time. 
Since interchange standards are usually periodically updated, concurrent use of different versions may be required.
Large (and/or federated) organizations typically need to use different versions of an interchange standard to meet internal organizational interoperability requirements.
For example, the enterprise-wide standard might use HL7 v2.5 for Lab messages, but some regions of the enterprise might be at a lower level.
It should be possible to retire deprecated interchange standards versions when applicable business cycles are completed while maintaining obsolete versions.  An example use of this is for possible claims adjustment throughout the claim’s life cycle.
When interchange standards change over time, it is important that retrospective analysis and research correlate and note gaps between the different versions’ information structures to support the permanence of concepts over time. An example use of this is the calculation of outcome or performance measures from persisted data stores where one version of a relevant interchange standard, e.g., CDA Release 1 captures the relevant data, e.g., discharge data, differently than CDA Release 2.</Description>

			<Statement>Support workflow management functions including both the management and set up of work queues, personnel lists, and system interfaces as well as the implementation functions that use workflow-related business rules to direct the flow of work assignments.</Statement>
			<Description>Workflow management functions that an EHR-S supports include: 
-Distribution of information to and from internal and external parties; 
-Support for task-management as well as parallel and serial task distribution;
-Support for notification and task routing based on system triggers; and 
-Support for task assignments, escalations and redirection in accordance with business rules. 
Workflow definitions and management may be implemented by a designated application or distributed across an EHR-S.</Description>
