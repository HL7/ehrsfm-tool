NOTES
=====
MAXExporter - uses the EA API through COM
MAXExporter2 - uses EA SQL XML calls (is somewhat faster)

TODO
====
- MAXImporter: 
	-!! switch to ElementValueXxx instead of XPathSelectElements!
	-!! go through MAXModel when importing!

	- figure out how to update relationships
	- how to detect deletes of objects/relationships when updating
	- check object.type & relationship.type in allowed valueset
	- !! detect GUID or ID used as MAX.id

	- !! figure out how to set ID/GUID in new models, they are assigned by EA, so they will change on clean import, move to MAX:ID tagged value, also take alias into account
	!! Idea: Use ID/GUID if possible, otherwise use TaggedValue "MAX::ID"!

- MAXExporter(2):
	- Q: Multiple tagged values with the same name result in multiple elements with the samen name, how to handle that in a spreadsheet?
	  A: Through an XSLT!
- MAXExporter2:
	- use GUID's as alternative to ID's
	- also support Diagrams -> Diagram serves as a selection of the elements to export!
	- add Tagged Values of selected package
	- add attributes
- MAXSchema:
	- sync UML model of schema (in EAP)!
- Excel binding document, figure out multi tagged value binding; <tag><value><notes>
- MAXExporter
	- delete if all functionality is in MAXExporter2

CHANGELOG
=========
[2013-may-07]
MAXExporter2:
- Made it more robust by adding and using Extension Methods to XElement that check for null.

[2013-apr-24]
MAXExporter2:
- Package_ID and Object_ID are 2 idspace. So there can be an Package with id=5 and an object with id=5.
  In EA a Package has both ID's. MAX has only one idspace and therefore has to use Object_ID. Fixed.
ProgressWindow:
- on-top of parent instead of on-top of all.
MAXImporter:
- Also set Package TreePos!

[2013-apr-18]
MAXExporter2:
- Repository.EnableCache to speedup export!

[2013-apr-12]
MAXExporter2:
- join t_package and t_object reliable on ea_guid instead of unreliable Name
  ea_guid is the same for the Package and its Element

[2013-mrt-28]
MAXImporter:
- Replaced "\n" to "\r\n" == newline in EA notes!

[2013-mrt-26]
MAXImporter/MAXSchema.xsd:
- Implemented attributes
- Relationship type Composition -> Closed Aggregation
- Keep order of objects and attributes in Project Browser (using Element.TreePos, Attribute.Pos)

[2013-mrt-19]
MAXImporter:
- Also import Packages and new tag format
MAXExporter2:
- Stereotype of object can be NULL, check for that.
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>
MAXExporter:
- Changed the <tag> format to <tag name= value=>notes</tag>

[2013-mrt-15/16/17]
QuickAccessViewControl:
- Added Quick Access Buttons View!
MAXExporter2:
- Reimplementation of the MAX Exporter using the SQLQuery interface to the UML Model.
- Keep HTML formatting as unescaped XML in the Package and Element notes. Not for TaggedValues since no formatting is allowed there.
- Add "exportDate" attribute to model element.
- Added selected package

[2013-mrt-13]
MAXExporter/Importer:
- Tagged values in repeating child "tag" element with name, value and notes childs. If you want to use in spreadsheet, use a transform.
- MaxExporter: experimental add attribute child elements.
- MAXExporter: export in background thread

[2013-mrt-06]
-- Separated MAX classes from UMCG_EA_AddIn.

[2013-mrt-06]
MAXExporter:
- on export add/update MAX::LastExportDate tag to exported package
MAXImporter:
- on import add/update MAX::LastImportDate tag to imported package

[2013-feb-27]
MAXExporter/Importer/xsd:
- added optional "Element.modified" property to object

[2012-nov-21]
MAXExporter:
- For now replace ':' in Tagged Values with a '_'

[2012-nov-19]
MAXSchema.xsd:
- added alias attribute of object
MAXExporter:
- Add support from Package (for all Elements) and Diagram to filter Elements
- Include parentId for nested Elements
- Include Package Element
- Add parentID to child elements of package

[2012-oct-11]
MAXImporter:
- object.type & relationship.type may not be empty; if the xml tag is empty, use default

[2012-oct-09]
MAXImporter: all child elements of an object that start with "tag." will be placed as taggedvalue of that object
- in a single transaction; the Element.TaggedValues.GetByName doesnot work; so if there are multiple objects with the same id in one max.xml
- solved by calling Refresh on Element.TaggedValues

[2012-sep-12]
MAXExporter: initial
