-------
Package per Chapter
Package name = Chapter/Name
Package alias = Chapter/Alias
Package isNameSpace = true; handig bij "add references" beperken tot 1 chapter

Function
--------
Feature per Function
Feature stereotype = Function/Type "H" = Header, "F" = Function

Feature name = Function/ID + Function/Name e.g. DC.1 Care Management
Feature notes = "<b>Statement: </b>" + Function/Statement + "<b>Description: </b>" + Function/Description + 

Conformance Criteria
--------------------
Requirement name = ConformanceCriteria/ID + '#' + ConformanceCriteria/Text e.g. DC.1.2#3
Requirement tagged value "Optionality" = ConformanceCriteria/Optionality

Link
----
Add the following links (This is required to make the "Add Related" function of EA to work)
	Composition Aggregation for Function to Header
	Composition Aggregation for Header to Chapter

KEEP LINKS between functions.
!! DETECT and REMOVE DUBBLES links & SeeAlso's

Directed Dependency from the Function of the Criteria to another Function by ConformanceCriteria/Link/FunctionID
?? Criteria to Function & Header makes EA function really slow, a lot of connections.
?? This connector is actually not very usefull. The most interesting are the functions.
